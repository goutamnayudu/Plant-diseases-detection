# Plant-diseases-detection
**I have created a small website for predecting the crop diseases and also providing the remidies.**
This project was done in py-charm environment. 
The data set was taken from kaagle website. In order to run this code we have to create an account in kaagle.
Save all the docs in a single folder to execute it prefectly.
